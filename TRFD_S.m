% Purpose:
%
% TRFD-S attempts to solve smooth problems of the form
%
% min f(x), subject to x in Omega,
%
% where F: R^(n) -> R and where Omega can be the unconstrained set or a box
%
% by applying the method proposed in the paper

% https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17366, 2025.
%
% INPUT:
%  
%   x0 [n x 1]: initial point
%   Ffun: function provided by the user that computes f
%   nfmax [1 x 1]: maximum number of function evaluations allowed
%   lb [n x 1]: lower bound on x ([] if no lower bound)
%   ub [n x 1]: upper bound on x ([] if no upper bound)
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   x_min [n x 1]: vector yielding the lowest function value found by TRFD-S
%   f_min [1 x 1]: lowest function value found by TRFD-S
%   nf [1 x 1]: number of function evaluations used 
%   stop [1 x 1]: an integer identifying the reason TRFD-S stopped:
%           
%        stop = 1: number of function evaluations >= nf_max
%        stop = 2: trust-region radius less than Delta_tol 
%        stop = -1: error in the execution of the subproblem
%        
%   H [nfmax x 1]: a vector such that H(i) is the smallest value of
%                   f(x) obtained by TRFD-S after i function evaluations

% Nevertheless, we still provide H to allow the users to plot data profiles in a fair way.

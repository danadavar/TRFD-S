function [x_min, f_min, nf, stop, H] = TRFD (x0, Ffun, nfmax, M, v, lb, ub, instance)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Purpose:
%
% TRFD attempts to solve composite problems of the form
%
% min f(x) = h (F(x)), subject to x in Omega,
%
% where F: R^(n) -> R^(m) and where the function h: R^(m) -> R
% can be the L1-norm, the Max-function or the Identity function,
% and where Omega can be the unconstrained set, a box or a polytope
%
% by applying the method proposed in the paper
%
% D. Davar, G. N. Grapiglia: TRFD: A derivative-free trust-region method 
% based on finite differences for composite nonsmooth optimization
%
% INPUT:
%  
%   x0 [n x 1]: initial point
%   Ffun: function provided by the user that computes F
%   nfmax [1 x 1]: maximum number of function evaluations allowed
%   M [... x n]: matrix for linear constraints on x ([] if no matrix)
%   V [... x 1]: vector for linear constraints on x ([] if no vector)
%   lb [1 x 1]: lower bound on x ([] if no lower bound)
%   ub [1 x 1]: upper bound on x ([] if no upper bound)
%   instance [1 x 1]: defines the outer function h and the p-norm used 
%                     by TRFD to solve the trust-region subproblems:
%
%       1 for L1 problems      (p = 1)
%       2 for L1 problems      (p = 2)
%       3 for L1 problems      (p = Inf)
%
%       4 for Minimax problems (p = 1 or p = Inf)
%       5 for Minimax problems (p = 2)
%
%       6 for Smooth problems  (p = 1)
%       7 for Smooth problems  (p = 2)
%       8 for Smooth problems  (p = Inf)
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%   x_min [n x 1] = vector yielding the lowest function value found within
%                   nfmax evaluations
%   f_min [1 x 1] = lowest function value found with nfmax evaluations
%   nf [1 x 1] = number of function evaluations used 
%   stop [1 x 1] = an integer identifying the reason TRFD stopped:
%           
%        stop = 1: number of function evaluations >= nf_max
%        stop = 2: trust-region radius less than Delta_tol 
%        stop = 3: approximate stationarity measure less than eta_tol
%        stop = -1: error in the execution of linprog or fmincon
%        
%   H [nfmax x 1] = a vector such that H(i) is the smallest value of
%                   h (F(x)) obtained by TRFD after i function evaluations
%
